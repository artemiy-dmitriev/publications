Each gravitational         wave (GW) signal provides the luminosity distance to the source,         and we estimate the corresponding redshift using two methods:         the redshifted masses and a galaxy catalog. Using the binary         black hole (BBH) redshifted masses, we simultaneously infer the         source mass distribution and H(z). The source mass distribution         displays a peak around 34 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, followed         by a drop-off. Assuming this mass scale does not evolve with the         redshift results in a H(z) measurement, yielding         ${H}_{0}={68}_{-8}^{+12}\,\mathrm{km}\ \,\         {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ (68\% credible interval)         when combined with the H $_{0}$ measurement from GW170817 and         its electromagnetic counterpart. This represents an improvement         of 17\% with respect to the H $_{0}$ estimate from GWTC-1. The         second method associates each GW event with its probable host         galaxy in the catalog GLADE+, statistically marginalizing over         the redshifts of each event's potential hosts. Assuming a fixed         BBH population, we estimate a value of         ${H}_{0}={68}_{-6}^{+8}\,\mathrm{km}\ \,\         {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ with the galaxy catalog         method, an improvement of 42\% with respect to our GWTC-1 result         and 20\% with respect to recent H $_{0}$ studies using GWTC-2         events. However, we show that this result is strongly impacted         by assumptions about the BBH source mass distribution; the only         event which is not strongly impacted by such assumptions (and is         thus informative about H $_{0}$) is the well-localized event         GW190814.},

Searches were for emission from the l = m = 2 mass         quadrupole mode with a frequency at only twice the pulsar         rotation frequency (single harmonic) and the l = 2, m = 1, 2         modes with a frequency of both once and twice the rotation         frequency (dual harmonic). No evidence of GWs was found, so we         present 95\% credible upper limits on the strain amplitudes h         $_{0}$ for the single-harmonic search along with limits on the         pulsars' mass quadrupole moments Q $_{22}$ and ellipticities ɛ.         Of the pulsars studied, 23 have strain amplitudes that are lower         than the limits calculated from their electromagnetically         measured spin-down rates. These pulsars include the millisecond         pulsars J0437-4715 and J0711-6830, which have spin-down ratios         of 0.87 and 0.57, respectively. For nine pulsars, their spin-         down limits have been surpassed for the first time. For the Crab         and Vela pulsars, our limits are factors of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 and         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20 more constraining than their         spin-down limits, respectively. For the dual-harmonic searches,         new limits are placed on the strain amplitudes C $_{21}$ and C         $_{22}$. For 23 pulsars, we also present limits on the emission         amplitude assuming dipole radiation as predicted by Brans-Dicke         theory.},

  abstract = {Isolated neutron stars that are asymmetric with respect to their spin         axis are possible sources of detectable continuous gravitational         waves. This paper presents a fully coherent search for such         signals from eighteen pulsars in data from LIGO and Virgo's         third observing run (O3). For known pulsars, efficient and         sensitive matched-filter searches can be carried out if one         assumes the gravitational radiation is phase-locked to the         electromagnetic emission. In the search presented here, we relax         this assumption and allow both the frequency and the time         derivative of the frequency of the gravitational waves to vary         in a small range around those inferred from electromagnetic         observations. We find no evidence for continuous gravitational         waves, and set upper limits on the strain amplitude for each         target. These limits are more constraining for seven of the         targets than the spin-down limit defined by ascribing all         rotational energy loss to gravitational radiation. In an         additional search, we look in O3 data for long-duration (hours-         months) transient gravitational waves in the aftermath of pulsar         glitches for six targets with a total of nine glitches. We         report two marginal outliers from this search, but find no clear         evidence for such emission either. The resulting duration-         dependent strain upper limits do not surpass indirect energy         constraints for any of these targets.},

KAGRA is a cryogenic and underground         gravitational-wave detector consisting of a laser interferometer         with 3 km arms, located in Kamioka, Gifu, Japan. GEO 600 is a         British-German laser interferometer with 600 m arms, located         near Hannover, Germany. GEO 600 and KAGRA performed a joint         observing run from April 7 to 20, 2020. We present the results         of the joint analysis of the GEO-KAGRA data for transient         gravitational-wave signals, including the coalescence of         neutron-star binaries and generic unmodeled transients. We also         perform dedicated searches for binary coalescence signals and         generic transients associated with gamma-ray burst events         observed during the joint run. No gravitational-wave events were         identified. We evaluate the minimum detectable amplitude for         various types of transient signals and the spacetime volume for         which the network is sensitive to binary neutron-star         coalescences. We also place lower limits on the distances to the         gamma-ray bursts analyzed based on the non-detection of an         associated gravitational-wave signal for several signal models,         including binary coalescences. These analyses demonstrate the         feasibility and utility of KAGRA as a member of the global         gravitational-wave detector network.},

Triggers from 22 FRBs were analyzed with a search that targets         both binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole         (NSBH) mergers. A targeted search for generic GW transients was         conducted on 40 FRBs. We find no significant evidence for a GW         association in either search. Given the large uncertainties in         the distances of our FRB sample, we are unable to exclude the         possibility of a GW association. Assessing the volumetric event         rates of both FRB and binary mergers, an association is limited         to 15\% of the FRB population for BNS mergers or 1\% for NSBH         mergers. We report 90\% confidence lower bounds on the distance         to each FRB for a range of GW progenitor models and set upper         limits on the energy emitted through GWs for a range of emission         scenarios. We find values of order {}10$^{51}$-{}10$^{57}$ erg         for models with central GW frequencies in the range 70-3560 Hz.         At the sensitivity of this search, we find these limits to be         above the predicted GW emissions for the models considered.

This is a semicoherent search         that uses details of the signal model to coherently combine data         separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be         adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search         covered a range of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25 to         1600 Hz, as well as ranges in orbital speed, frequency, and         phase determined from observational constraints. No significant         detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a         function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100         and 200 Hz, correspond to an amplitude h $_{0}$ of about         10$^{-25}$ when marginalized isotropically over the unknown         inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less         than 4 {\texttimes} 10$^{-26}$ assuming the optimal orientation.         The sensitivity of this search is now probing amplitudes         predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For the usual         conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the         neutron star, our isotropically marginalized upper limits are         close to the predicted amplitude from about 70 to 100 Hz; the         limits assuming that the neutron star spin is aligned with the         most likely orbital angular momentum are below the conservative         torque balance predictions from 40 to 200 Hz. Assuming a broader         range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-         wave amplitude delve into the relevant parameter space over a         wide range of frequencies, to 500 Hz or more.},

  abstract = {The global network of gravitational-wave observatories now includes five         detectors, namely LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, KAGRA,         and GEO 600. These detectors collected data during their third         observing run, O3, composed of three phases: O3a starting in         2019 April and lasting six months, O3b starting in 2019 November         and lasting five months, and O3GK starting in 2020 April and         lasting two weeks. In this paper we describe these data and         various other science products that can be freely accessed         through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center at         https://gwosc.org. The main data set, consisting of the         gravitational-wave strain time series that contains the         astrophysical signals, is released together with supporting data         useful for their analysis and documentation, tutorials, as well         as analysis software packages.},
